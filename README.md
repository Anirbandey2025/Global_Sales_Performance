Global Sales Performance Dashboard | Microsoft Excel | Advanced Excel BI Project

Objective: To enable management to track performance by category, geography, and time—using only Excel’s built-in BI capabilities. 

I built this interactive sales performance dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales trends, profit growth, and customer distribution across regions from 2014–2017.


Key Insights:
• Technology & Office Supplies drove consistent profit growth, while Furniture lagged in comparison.
• California & New York emerged as top-performing states, contributing the highest revenue and customer count.
• Phones and Chairs were the leading sales categories, each crossing ₹3 L + in total sales.
• Top customers like Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch significantly influenced total profit share.
• Monthly sales showed steady upward momentum with seasonal dips, indicating predictable business cycles.


Tools & Techniques Used :
• Power Query for data cleaning & transformation
• Pivot Tables, Slicers & Timelines for interactivity
• Conditional formatting & dynamic charts for insights visualization
